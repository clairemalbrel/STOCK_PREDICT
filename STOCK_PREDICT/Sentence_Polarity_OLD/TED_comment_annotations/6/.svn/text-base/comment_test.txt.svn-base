1. FRONTLINE/World Fellows Rob Harris and Tovin Lapan traveled to Colombia in August 2005 to investigate charges that the Coca-Cola Company was involved in the violent repression of a union at several of its bottling plants. The soft drink company strenuously denies the allegations of union-busting and murder of union leaders. But there is growing pressure on the Atlanta, Georgia-based multinational from shareholders and U.S. colleges boycotting Coke to approve a full-scale, independent investigation of the charges.

3. Interesting.  I have just one comment for you to consider. 
This isn't "wrong" or a "mistake" it's crucial for individual health and success.  When an individual is already healthy (has an abundance of needed resources) to start with, it's logical/valuable for it to play it safe - to conserve resources to be used to create more value.  But when an individual is not healthy (has a deficiency of needed resources) to begin with, it is more logical/valuable for it to take a risk to get enough resources to become healthy.  So the starting point does indeed make a difference, logically.  We're not supposed to be objective when it comes to personal health, because what is good for one person now, very well might NOT be good for another person, or even us, later.  So subjectivity, and bias, are both logical and crucial for decision making.

5. It's a shame that at 13:12 Sam Harris degenerates into generalised assumption and the misrepresentation of bigottry and phobia which is in fact a bigotted/phobic action in itself. If Harris believes in science, he should be discoursing the relevant merits of his faith instead of slandering the religious beliefs of other faithful. 
To be sure..., saying "You bad!" is not saying "I good!". 
For Harris' intent to stand up straight and to be counted, he ought to assert why "He good!" while avoiding remarks that generalise three of the world's four major moral codes and avoiding misrepresenting the mistakes of one said moral code so as to strawman the others. 
Up to that point I was rooting for Harris but since he commits the same insipid and blindly faithful slanders that too many religious "demagogues" are apt, how is he going to represent a scientific moral code that purports to be morally superior?

Most people would have been terrified, and angry and indignant, and after a few months quite ill.

7. It's not just about making sure arts are funded. This is one of the problems he's dressing, albeit on a more underlying level: nurturing creativity just mean funding the arts, it's about making sure kids grow up learning that no field is vastly more important than another. It's about teaching all the subjects in a way that doesn't squander students' creative abilities. Creativity is just important in sciences, mathematics and languages as it is in all the arts. Imagine this, a head medical researcher with no creativity. Do you think they'll accomplish anything? Will they bring anything new and important to the world? It is vital to the healthy continued existence of not only our species but the entire planet, that creativity is recognized as an invaluable asset in all careers and lifestyles, and that as a society we need artists and writers and creative thinkers just as much as we need budding scientists and revolutionary doctors and law makers with open and creative minds.

8. Greed is the problem, absolutely.  Why is the US the lead in obesity, financial collapse, and inequalities of many variations?  Money = Success.  This is the core of the American and now near global dream.  It's killing us in every which way.  A severley warped sense of humanity and our true aspirations. We are capable of much more. 
What do you expect from a society that now has corporatocracy at the top of the heap.  The corporate message has been so effective, not that there has been much choice through events of the C20, that it it almost mainstream globally. 
Good to see that voices from within are trying to make a difference.  However I am sorry to see that they may be too late in the light of the latest Federal Reserve warnings. 
I hope for the sake of humanity that we can come away from this enlightened without further war and suffering.  Greed is a really bad motivator, it's evil.  It's killing us....

11. @ phillip:  this ted talk has many slides, including the "apple pi" slide, that contain satire significant to those who are aware of American culture and history.  Past propaganda here in the US has used culturally significant items such as apple pie as symbols of "freedom" that we are told our enemies hate and want to destroy.  Projecting this onto a drone pic w/ Arabic script, claiming it doesn't like apple "pi" further illustrates the absurdity of that form of propaganda meme.

In fact, Pinker recognized Minsky's influence on him during his farewell speech at MIT.

15. i feel i have to note here, i always hear a lot about helping the poor move up, and away from poverty, as though promoting fiscal wealth is the only means to solve the consequences of poverty--starvation, a lack of health care, et cetera. and perhaps within the realm of today's economically driven societies this is true. but if upward momentum is the only solution to poverty, poverty will never be solved; as people will continue to scramble for the top, endlessly, stepping on the backs of those below them to get there. 
instead perhaps it's worth considering merely addressing the ability of all people to meet their basic needs, equally. i know the majority of this video discusses just that... Amy Smith's work using first world influences to help poor people find better ways to do common things. but she does seem to put a lot of focus on how little $400 is, and how these poor can also use the technology to profit. is that really important?

17. OK- so I had to respond to this one. First off- I'm gay, and was raised Christian. I've questioned many things about both science and religion. I do believe I have authority to speak on the Science vs. God topic. What if Science were just another language of God. For instance- we can explain through notation, music. We can explain through math the mysteries of the universe. Science is A language OF God. Science, in my opinion does not disprove God, but prove him. The more we find, the less we realize we actually KNOW. God, to me, is not measurable. Anything in science that is measurable is, in my mind, a manifestation of things that have been created. The nature in which they work are mysterious and awesome- however- HOW they work does not disprove God anymore than musical notation disproves sound. My point being, what if science and religion were married. What if we took a step back and realized that God is quintessential to our existence and science could prove both God and Evolution

18. Political issue? nope, totally not. I think we should open eyes for the global warming problem. I felt the weather conditions are changed a lot in this year. Only in one year my country had landslide and flood loads of time. Warning alarming is already started. But where is the big leader to lead people to the right direction? company? goverment? each person who lives in the earth?  
Do you think people don't know about this warming problem? That's why you needed to get advices from marketers? hmm..let people know about problem is enough I think. 
We need to learn. Learn about the solution by big system, as goverment. I'm not suggesting 'make a politics'. Education. children or adult whoever need to learn where we live and when we can live with this 'global warming' earth condition. 
Thanks for waking me up from non-interested person who part of the warming earth!

20. In my college, there is a small number of teachers who would believe in the hierarchy of subjects.  Unfortunately we work within a educational framework driven by politicians who hark back to the the easily measurable, and therefore politically exploitable themes of literacy and numeracy.  If we want to free up the creativity in our education system, we need to give the education professionals the space to do this.  May-be that's the crux of the problem, creativity is so hard to measure, and if the system (ie. the policy makers) demands 'accountability' we need to teach stuff that can be measured.

21. I am very much impressed. He hit the nail on the head! Meaningful education, instilling in young leaders not just an african pride (we r way too hung up on this concept) or knowledge but allow them to think through how to work in an ethical way, how the use of what they learn affect the community.  
We all have to start somewhere and education is key. You can tell people what to do but if they do not know "why" they are doing it, for what purpose, soon you will have another generation of selfish, greedy-tribalistic leaders, in Africa's case. To me, being a leader has to do with doing what you can, where you are with what you have for the "good" of those around you. There's nothing wrong with teaching the young to excel, to become judges, doctors, computer scientists, not for the sake of position itself but to be in a position to do "good". As an aspiring developper, that's what my mission is.  
Someone who physically builds roads is as much needed as a dentist, what matters is their character and whether either has been taught about their value in the community and how they can do the best in their roles. The goal is not to make people rich, poverty will always exist. A politician is as prone to greed as a bus driver-so its not about creating a class of the elits, its about instilling values/critical thinking patterns &amp; a sense of community that is greater than self. Some will fall through the cracks, but those who will get it,will do good where they are, with what they have...That's a leader.

I was wondering about one part of this speech, the "anti-conspirationnist" minute : as a sceptic, shouldn't he question the "official" statement about 9/11 (or any controversal  historical event) ?  
I mean :  some people do not believe humans walked on the moon. Right. 
Is it so impossible to believe we actually did - and in the same time believe the official video is a fake ?

24. I am not surprised by the criticism this talk has received and appreciate that so many have taken the time to watch and comment on it.  I know I have especially angered people who are part of the group I belonged to.  Still I contend that it is worth examining extremism as a cognitive processing problem and that the lines I have drawn between what I went through and historical atrocities are valid.  Looking at belief systems, especially those which fall under the umbrella of religion, as a cognitive functioning problem with potentially highly dangerous consequences touches a lot of nerves.  We need to look at it though, because extremism is a big problem and it happens inside the human brain.  It is so easy to label extremists as stupid or evil people but before extremism sets in there is vulnerability.  Maybe we can lower vulnerability through examination of this issue.

27. As Sir Ken Robinson puts out there, school kill creativity. My opinion is that the concequences of this fact are even more far reaching then the surface shows.  
Technology to me is evolution. Technology is the platform on which we pull ourselfs higher, both as an individual as well as a society. It is the platform of creative expression and the tool we use to carve into the world around us. By killing creativity, we slow this process down by unimaginable percentages. Everytime an individual, or a group of individuals, finds a platform in which they can express there creative capacity and combine this with their talent en knowledge we see amazing things. Success is inevitable. We think of it as the lucky few, a brilliant marketeer or find it that this someone has abilities others don&rsquo;t have. But we&rsquo;re all like that. We just need the platforms to express is it. Creativity is the key, or at least &ndash; one of the key components. We need to give creativity the weight back is deserves, so thanks again Sir Ken Robinson!

28. Its wonderful beautiful but not what a child needs at least not a young one.  Shilo Shiv Suleman mentions how the childs fantasy is being lost, but her books do not really inspire creativity and imagination  in a young child.  In a way its making a movie out of a book which is something that as a young child i hated how they destroyed the world i had built inside my mind, the faces, the voices, cities, countries, empires all stolen from me.  Instead of nurturing the young childs fantasy it is replacing it with yours and an imperfect version at that. 
it is brilliant work that may be ok for an older child especialy if it could take a larger part in making but it just is not the right thing for a young child 
hopefully you can understand what i mean...

29. TED says Ideas Worth Spreading??? Yet... 
TED's rules not only kill creativity, but reduce the ability of TED to reach a broader audience. 
For example, I could use clips from speeches in my blogs, direct them to TED with a link for the full talk... but it's against their rules.  
I could give my readers the minute &amp; second mark  to go to as a start point for the point I'm making in my blog, but as Ed de Bono says... we are passive, lazy ,consumers. And we are. 
I don't want my readers to work to get to the point, I want them to click and watch. Otherwise they might just click on by.  
I lose, and TED loses. 
Might just break their rules anyway. :(

32. to A Latif continued...lastly you discussed the issue of proof.  
You pointed out that the historical record was scientific - had I known you believed this then I wouldn't have made the point. The banding of history in as social "science" is commonly loosely associated with the Euro-Germanic school of history whilst banding it as an art is asssociated with the Anglo-American school of history. As a Brit,  I wrongly assumed which position you were taking. Whilst I disagree with the reduction of all disciplines of knowledge to "science" we can agree on the idea that a range of sources can be used from which to derive logical conclusions. If you want to ask me about the combination of these various pieces of evidence it would probably be better to do it one by one. 
Finally, you did, as I expected take me to task over "faith."  You state "When Faith comes, supported by rhetoric, sophistry and polemics, neither logic nor evidence would work." I agree but that is not what I mean by Faith.

36. I see everything here is being diverted to politics. My main motive here to tell is that its human nature to have hatered which has been installed hundreds of years in histrory and comes from within. When I get to know someone from pakistan, my mind does not think I have to hate him, but something inside forces me to see how we are different(in a positive way as everyone below has done). This mindset gets fueled when things like mumbai attacks, kargil war takes place which I dont think so were politics driven if everything is arranged from pakistan. If a son is thief you should try to make him right rather than taking side of your son and denying it, which will make him a better thief. But, its really a positive attitude by pakistan youth to tell the world that we also need peace, but now its time these youth should be saying "OK THATS IT, WE ARE MAKING IT RIGHT AND CLEAN" go guyz.India will be with you if you support peace.

She makes use of identities in many of her books, well that's her choice but regardless of the western approach to "the rest" -writers from elsewhere, it's a fact that these topics are very popular, so much so that it became a habit of several Nobel prize winners to exploit it. 
I'm sick of this identity politics, which you aren't even aware of. If people want to cling on their identities and create newer ones that is their problem but embedding all that crap into novels and turning this into a habit is a very cheap trick to get recognition. 
Obviously, it's safe to write such a book after you get your recognition once you are done with conveying a prioris belonging to a prevalent, very non-fiction argument in the subtext of "The Bastard of Istanbul", which in the first place fired up her publicity and career abroad.

41. I think this issue is not a generational one.  As a couples counselor, I am constantly encountering men of my generation (late gen-x) who tune out, procrastinate, and seem unable to take up the duties of being an adult. Perhaps it could be said that video games filled a need in boys, created a place where the could feel smart, a place that used to be solely occupied by sports. [Games have created a place for non-jocks to excel?]  But the reality is that many many American men and fathers are still playing video games at night and avoid and resent issues of responsibility in their lives.  This issue is not about violence, guns, etc.  This is about a fundamental disempowerment of men in our cultural system.  An internal disempowerment that leads to violence, misogyny, and a culture full of unfulfilled men and women.  What's the fun of being a smart girl if there are no guys to go on the adventure with you?

42. I am constantly amazed that people are so willing to share uninformed opinions   
In Audrey de Grey's TED talk on aging, he says: "I'm going to talk about five different things. I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable. I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together, and actually talk about this a bit more than we do. I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course. I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging." http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging.html 
de Grey is a controversial figure in the field is you might want to read his TED profile 
Gregory Petsko's TED talk on aging is a bit more alarming, so take note.  He says, " For 12,000 years, the distribution of ages in the human population has looked like a pyramid, with the oldest on top. It&rsquo;s already flattening out. By 2050, it&rsquo;s going to be a column and will start to invert. This is why it&rsquo;s happening. The average lifespan&rsquo;s more than doubled since 1840, and it&rsquo;s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day. And this is why that&rsquo;s not entirely a good thing: because over the age of 65, your risk of getting Alzheimer&rsquo;s or Parkinson&rsquo;s disease will increase exponentially. By 2050, there&rsquo;ll be about 32 million people in the United States over the age of 80, and unless we do something about it, half of them will have Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and three million more will have Parkinson&rsquo;s disease." http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/gregory_petsko_on_the_coming_neurological_epidemic.html 
Finally, Dan Buettner's TED talk offers some simple advice:  "Something called the Danish Twin Study established that only about 10 percent of how long the average person lives, within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes. The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle." http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/dan_buettner_how_to_live_to_be_100.html

While there are many difficulties in devoting oneself to a life of religion, I find this more of a protracted confession as a member of the clergy, admitting that one simply has to have faith for faith itself to exist. The conclusion of this speech was a little disappointing, as I wish that Rev. Honey would have taken something other than a non-stance.

49. I've been following TED for quite some time, and I must say that Kaki King, while talented, doesn't quite do it for me.  I feel like there is a missing connection between the guitar, the playing, the musician and music.  There's a lot of playing happening, but I'm not hearing the music.  "Pink Noise" I could understand, but I guess my preference is just for something a little more thought-provoking from TED, even when it comes to Entertainment.  
I may be biased, but I highly suggest checking out Trevor Gordon Hall ( www.trevorgordonhall.com ) for some truly virtuosic playing and melody writing along the fingerstyle lines.  With a background in theology and the mystics, he infuses his philosopy and beliefs into each new tune. 
For example, "Starry Night Over the Rhone" paints a musical picture inspired by the painted landscape by Van Gogh.  Or, check out an acoustic rendering of the Beatle's "Come Together." 
He is a musician I would LOVE to hear at TED.  Anyone agree?

51. This reminds me of an activity I once observed at Air Force Academy basic training. The activity is intended to help the cadets "learn how to think" and how to "work collaboratively." The cadets are presented with a venue that includes a number of items and an objective. They are tasked with working together, using the items at their disposal, to accomplish the objective. Some of the creative, out of the box solutions, were fantastic. It was the first time I'd seen this type of activity in an educational setting. It is a great idea to introduce this type of activity at age 7, rather than waiting until a kid is 17 or 18. I hope Tulley "packages" this concept, making it available to educators across the country. (I also hope he has good liability insurance.)

54. I think the speaker is right that management has to be more thoughtful and better planned.  He is, however, too extreme in some of the conclusions he draws. 
Unnecessary time wastage, interrupting work with meetings called too soon before they take place etc are examples of badly managed meetings, rather than necessarily being inherent in the nature of meetings themselves.  His argument is that badly managed meetings are counter-productive.  This is something of a tautology and very different from saying that meetings are not productive (or "toxic") which is the conclusion he goes on to draw. 
A well managed meeting of the right people at a convenient time (agreed well in advance) with clear aims and time limits can be extremely useful and helpful.  Indeed, many projects and jobs are much less efficiently (and enjoyably) done if the team doesn't assemble to share info/ideas from time to time.

55. I don't recommend you watch this video, it advocates excessive doubt. I think anyone engaged in any activity of any significant depth, already has a fairly sound conscientiousness governing their actions &ndash; and those who don&rsquo;t, probably don&rsquo;t give a damn about fair play anyways; So, for the vast majority of people, this video lecture amounts to advocating becoming self-conscious in a psychologically unhealthy, impeding way &ndash; at very least, if her recommended level of doubt is applied, it could be the difference between performing or creating brilliantly, and mediocrity. As for the presentation of her lecture: I think she knows that she is not listening to her own advice - which in the case of her thesis would have been the sound thing to do and not have given this lecture &ndash; because she sounds like she is proactively trying to overcome her nervousness in a way that makes her look and sound arrogant (which her thesis is) and patronizing as if she was talking to elementary school kids flirting with delinquency.

60. This talk was as entertaining as it was informative. An enjoyable succinct review of several related and very important issues. 
Some have commented that it is wrong to discuss problems without proffering solutions. I think this is totally wrong. Complex problems are rarely solved by one person. I view lectures like this as a kind of crowd-sourcing. Focusing the attention of large numbers of smart and motivated people with varying backgrounds, expertise and resources is a great way to begin a process of change. 
I do disagree with Ben's assertion that placebo comparators provide data that is totally useless to clinicians and his implication that new treatments should only be approved if they are better than the current best available. What if the patient cannot tolerate the side effects of best available treatment but could tolerate a new drug that is nearly as good but has tolerable side effects? Or what if best drug out there just does not work for a patient but a new drug that statistically has a smaller magnitude of effect works well for him/her. What if study drug A has 85% of the treatment effect of the gold standard but they could be used in combination for synergistic effect. These things need to be considered and placebo data can help sort this out.
