1. FRONTLINE/World Fellows Rob Harris and Tovin Lapan traveled to Colombia in August 2005 to investigate charges that the Coca-Cola Company was involved in the violent repression of a union at several of its bottling plants. The soft drink company strenuously denies the allegations of union-busting and murder of union leaders. But there is growing pressure on the Atlanta, Georgia-based multinational from shareholders and U.S. colleges boycotting Coke to approve a full-scale, independent investigation of the charges.

3. Interesting.  I have just one comment for you to consider. 
This isn't "wrong" or a "mistake" it's crucial for individual health and success.  When an individual is already healthy (has an abundance of needed resources) to start with, it's logical/valuable for it to play it safe - to conserve resources to be used to create more value.  But when an individual is not healthy (has a deficiency of needed resources) to begin with, it is more logical/valuable for it to take a risk to get enough resources to become healthy.  So the starting point does indeed make a difference, logically.  We're not supposed to be objective when it comes to personal health, because what is good for one person now, very well might NOT be good for another person, or even us, later.  So subjectivity, and bias, are both logical and crucial for decision making.

5. It's a shame that at 13:12 Sam Harris degenerates into generalised assumption and the misrepresentation of bigottry and phobia which is in fact a bigotted/phobic action in itself. If Harris believes in science, he should be discoursing the relevant merits of his faith instead of slandering the religious beliefs of other faithful. 
To be sure..., saying "You bad!" is not saying "I good!". 
For Harris' intent to stand up straight and to be counted, he ought to assert why "He good!" while avoiding remarks that generalise three of the world's four major moral codes and avoiding misrepresenting the mistakes of one said moral code so as to strawman the others. 
Up to that point I was rooting for Harris but since he commits the same insipid and blindly faithful slanders that too many religious "demagogues" are apt, how is he going to represent a scientific moral code that purports to be morally superior?

7. It's not just about making sure arts are funded. This is one of the problems he's dressing, albeit on a more underlying level: nurturing creativity just mean funding the arts, it's about making sure kids grow up learning that no field is vastly more important than another. It's about teaching all the subjects in a way that doesn't squander students' creative abilities. Creativity is just important in sciences, mathematics and languages as it is in all the arts. Imagine this, a head medical researcher with no creativity. Do you think they'll accomplish anything? Will they bring anything new and important to the world? It is vital to the healthy continued existence of not only our species but the entire planet, that creativity is recognized as an invaluable asset in all careers and lifestyles, and that as a society we need artists and writers and creative thinkers just as much as we need budding scientists and revolutionary doctors and law makers with open and creative minds.

8. Greed is the problem, absolutely.  Why is the US the lead in obesity, financial collapse, and inequalities of many variations?  Money = Success.  This is the core of the American and now near global dream.  It's killing us in every which way.  A severley warped sense of humanity and our true aspirations. We are capable of much more. 
What do you expect from a society that now has corporatocracy at the top of the heap.  The corporate message has been so effective, not that there has been much choice through events of the C20, that it it almost mainstream globally. 
Good to see that voices from within are trying to make a difference.  However I am sorry to see that they may be too late in the light of the latest Federal Reserve warnings. 
I hope for the sake of humanity that we can come away from this enlightened without further war and suffering.  Greed is a really bad motivator, it's evil.  It's killing us....

Projecting this onto a drone pic w/ Arabic script, claiming it doesn't like apple "pi" further illustrates the absurdity of that form of propaganda meme.

15. i feel i have to note here, i always hear a lot about helping the poor move up, and away from poverty, as though promoting fiscal wealth is the only means to solve the consequences of poverty--starvation, a lack of health care, et cetera. and perhaps within the realm of today's economically driven societies this is true. but if upward momentum is the only solution to poverty, poverty will never be solved; as people will continue to scramble for the top, endlessly, stepping on the backs of those below them to get there. 
instead perhaps it's worth considering merely addressing the ability of all people to meet their basic needs, equally. i know the majority of this video discusses just that... Amy Smith's work using first world influences to help poor people find better ways to do common things. but she does seem to put a lot of focus on how little $400 is, and how these poor can also use the technology to profit. is that really important?

17. OK- so I had to respond to this one. First off- I'm gay, and was raised Christian. I've questioned many things about both science and religion. I do believe I have authority to speak on the Science vs. God topic. What if Science were just another language of God. For instance- we can explain through notation, music. We can explain through math the mysteries of the universe. Science is A language OF God. Science, in my opinion does not disprove God, but prove him. The more we find, the less we realize we actually KNOW. God, to me, is not measurable. Anything in science that is measurable is, in my mind, a manifestation of things that have been created. The nature in which they work are mysterious and awesome- however- HOW they work does not disprove God anymore than musical notation disproves sound. My point being, what if science and religion were married. What if we took a step back and realized that God is quintessential to our existence and science could prove both God and Evolution

18. Political issue? nope, totally not. I think we should open eyes for the global warming problem. I felt the weather conditions are changed a lot in this year. Only in one year my country had landslide and flood loads of time. Warning alarming is already started. But where is the big leader to lead people to the right direction? company? goverment? each person who lives in the earth?  
Do you think people don't know about this warming problem? That's why you needed to get advices from marketers? hmm..let people know about problem is enough I think. 
We need to learn. Learn about the solution by big system, as goverment. I'm not suggesting 'make a politics'. Education. children or adult whoever need to learn where we live and when we can live with this 'global warming' earth condition.

20. In my college, there is a small number of teachers who would believe in the hierarchy of subjects.  Unfortunately we work within a educational framework driven by politicians who hark back to the the easily measurable, and therefore politically exploitable themes of literacy and numeracy.  If we want to free up the creativity in our education system, we need to give the education professionals the space to do this.  May-be that's the crux of the problem, creativity is so hard to measure, and if the system (ie. the policy makers) demands 'accountability' we need to teach stuff that can be measured.

21. I am very much impressed. He hit the nail on the head! Meaningful education, instilling in young leaders not just an african pride (we r way too hung up on this concept) or knowledge but allow them to think through how to work in an ethical way, how the use of what they learn affect the community.  
We all have to start somewhere and education is key. You can tell people what to do but if they do not know "why" they are doing it, for what purpose, soon you will have another generation of selfish, greedy-tribalistic leaders, in Africa's case. To me, being a leader has to do with doing what you can, where you are with what you have for the "good" of those around you. There's nothing wrong with teaching the young to excel, to become judges, doctors, computer scientists, not for the sake of position itself but to be in a position to do "good". As an aspiring developper, that's what my mission is.  
Someone who physically builds roads is as much needed as a dentist, what matters is their character and whether either has been taught about their value in the community and how they can do the best in their roles. The goal is not to make people rich, poverty will always exist. A politician is as prone to greed as a bus driver-so its not about creating a class of the elits, its about instilling values/critical thinking patterns &amp; a sense of community that is greater than self. Some will fall through the cracks, but those who will get it,will do good where they are, with what they have...That's a leader.

I was wondering about one part of this speech, the "anti-conspirationnist" minute : as a sceptic, shouldn't he question the "official" statement about 9/11 (or any controversal  historical event) ?  
I mean :  some people do not believe humans walked on the moon. Right.

24. I am not surprised by the criticism this talk has received and appreciate that so many have taken the time to watch and comment on it.  I know I have especially angered people who are part of the group I belonged to.  Still I contend that it is worth examining extremism as a cognitive processing problem and that the lines I have drawn between what I went through and historical atrocities are valid.  Looking at belief systems, especially those which fall under the umbrella of religion, as a cognitive functioning problem with potentially highly dangerous consequences touches a lot of nerves.  We need to look at it though, because extremism is a big problem and it happens inside the human brain.  It is so easy to label extremists as stupid or evil people but before extremism sets in there is vulnerability.  Maybe we can lower vulnerability through examination of this issue.

27. As Sir Ken Robinson puts out there, school kill creativity. My opinion is that the concequences of this fact are even more far reaching then the surface shows.  
Technology to me is evolution. Technology is the platform on which we pull ourselfs higher, both as an individual as well as a society. It is the platform of creative expression and the tool we use to carve into the world around us. By killing creativity, we slow this process down by unimaginable percentages. Everytime an individual, or a group of individuals, finds a platform in which they can express there creative capacity and combine this with their talent en knowledge we see amazing things. Success is inevitable. We think of it as the lucky few, a brilliant marketeer or find it that this someone has abilities others don&rsquo;t have. But we&rsquo;re all like that. We just need the platforms to express is it. Creativity is the key, or at least &ndash; one of the key components. We need to give creativity the weight back is deserves, so thanks again Sir Ken Robinson!

28. Its wonderful beautiful but not what a child needs at least not a young one.  Shilo Shiv Suleman mentions how the childs fantasy is being lost, but her books do not really inspire creativity and imagination  in a young child.  In a way its making a movie out of a book which is something that as a young child i hated how they destroyed the world i had built inside my mind, the faces, the voices, cities, countries, empires all stolen from me.  Instead of nurturing the young childs fantasy it is replacing it with yours and an imperfect version at that. 
it is brilliant work that may be ok for an older child especialy if it could take a larger part in making but it just is not the right thing for a young child 
hopefully you can understand what i mean...

TED's rules not only kill creativity, but reduce the ability of TED to reach a broader audience.

I could give my readers the minute &amp; second mark  to go to as a start point for the point I'm making in my blog, but as Ed de Bono says... we are passive, lazy ,consumers. And we are. 
I don't want my readers to work to get to the point, I want them to click and watch. Otherwise they might just click on by.  
I lose, and TED loses. 
Might just break their rules anyway. :(

32. to A Latif continued...lastly you discussed the issue of proof.  
You pointed out that the historical record was scientific - had I known you believed this then I wouldn't have made the point. The banding of history in as social "science" is commonly loosely associated with the Euro-Germanic school of history whilst banding it as an art is asssociated with the Anglo-American school of history. As a Brit,  I wrongly assumed which position you were taking. Whilst I disagree with the reduction of all disciplines of knowledge to "science" we can agree on the idea that a range of sources can be used from which to derive logical conclusions. If you want to ask me about the combination of these various pieces of evidence it would probably be better to do it one by one. 
Finally, you did, as I expected take me to task over "faith."  You state "When Faith comes, supported by rhetoric, sophistry and polemics, neither logic nor evidence would work." I agree but that is not what I mean by Faith.

36. I see everything here is being diverted to politics. My main motive here to tell is that its human nature to have hatered which has been installed hundreds of years in histrory and comes from within. When I get to know someone from pakistan, my mind does not think I have to hate him, but something inside forces me to see how we are different(in a positive way as everyone below has done). This mindset gets fueled when things like mumbai attacks, kargil war takes place which I dont think so were politics driven if everything is arranged from pakistan. If a son is thief you should try to make him right rather than taking side of your son and denying it, which will make him a better thief. But, its really a positive attitude by pakistan youth to tell the world that we also need peace, but now its time these youth should be saying "OK THATS IT, WE ARE MAKING IT RIGHT AND CLEAN" go guyz.India will be with you if you support peace.

She makes use of identities in many of her books, well that's her choice but regardless of the western approach to "the rest" -writers from elsewhere, it's a fact that these topics are very popular, so much so that it became a habit of several Nobel prize winners to exploit it. 
I'm sick of this identity politics, which you aren't even aware of. If people want to cling on their identities and create newer ones that is their problem but embedding all that crap into novels and turning this into a habit is a very cheap trick to get recognition. 
Obviously, it's safe to write such a book after you get your recognition once you are done with conveying a prioris belonging to a prevalent, very non-fiction argument in the subtext of "The Bastard of Istanbul", which in the first place fired up her publicity and career abroad.

41. I am interested in the forecasts. If since 1960 the world with the exception of africa have been moving towards smaller families India and china have reduced there family size from around 7 children per women to 2.84 and 1.79 respectively it seems 70% of the worlds population is near or below the 2.1 we need to start reducing the world population. What I have a probem with is that population growth is forecast to reach 9 billion from the current 5.8 billiion by 2050. That is a 35% increase in 50 years I was thinking whether the forecasting statistics could be used to see 
1. whether the world population is slowing down over the next 100 years 
2. where the cut of is between the genaeration dieing that produced the high birth rates up 1980. 
I would like to see a graph of population growth that higlighted some of this as it would add a little meaning instead of the scare stories of over population of 9 billion by 2050. I am sure this will occur but by 2050 the dieing older generation will have been born and around 1980/90. 
I don't know whether gapminder can do this. pouplation growth is the main concern for the world and it environment everything else is a consequence of this.

47. To be honest, I think we simply have a misunderstanding. I do not believe in the non-existence of Zeus or any other deity. I would never tell anyone that their God doesn't exist, merely that I don't factor their existence into my life or my understanding of the universe. As for agnosticism being the scientific position, an agnostic does not believe in the existence of magic teapots and such, but at the same time he wouldn't reject such a theory without looking first at the facts. I fear that a militant atheist might do just that. In a similar manner to the church immediately rejecting heliocentricity without looking into it, I fear many good theories may be discounted and never looked into simply because there is a theistic clause. In the pursuit of knowledge, open-mindedness is key.  
As for "Until there is evidence, the proposition remains untrue," I think even this is the wrong approach. Before microscopes, was the existence of cells untrue (this phrasing makes no sense)? Really the mindset should be that until there is evidence, the proposition is unproven. It may or may not be true and until there is evidence it would be silly to form preconceptions that may influence our future decision on whether or not to believe it.

50. I have just found this site and am enjoying reading all of the comments below. I can see that some people agree with the Climate Change science, some do not, and some are somewhere in between.  To be honest it really seems like some people are missing the point: and the point is that it does not matter if the current change in climate is due to man or a natural cycle.  Regardless of what is happening, it is completely intolerable and inhumane to continue raping and pillaging the earth of it's environment. It is completely unacceptable to kill millions of defenselss people over oil and money. It is completely unacceptable for large corporations to go into poor countries and exploit desperate women and children by having them work 14 hours shifts producing plastic barbie dolls to be consumed by the "more fortunate" citizens of North America. 
Again, whether Climate Change is natural or man made does not really matter.  We need to start living with care and respect for each other and the planet we live in. I can see now why David Suzuki appears so frustrated and angry whevenever he appears on shows or radio.  For those of you who are not familiar with David Suzuki look him up on YouTube to see someone who is articulate, knowledgable, and extremely passionate about nature and the planet. 
Our entire world is connected, we need to treat it as such.  Lastly for anbody who is looking for a good book check out Blessed Unrest by Paul Hawken.

52. I, like the rest of you no doubt, consider myself a fairly intelligent person.  By no means am I a MENSA candidate, but I'm no idiot either.  Some of the things that Dawkins guy says intrigue me.  I'm a God-fearing believer (which apparently in a lot of mind inherently makes me stupid), so I honestly see things differently.  it's kind of strange, believing something 'just because' isn't too hard for me to do.  Heck, even nature's 'laws' we just believe. 
Nobody asks why gravity pulls, it just does.  Now, I understand that each atom has its own gravitational field, so collectively, the atoms that makeup planets give it its gravity.  But why does each atom have its own gravity... because it does.   
God never said stop looking for answers, these simply complex systems that make up our existence are here to bring our attention TO God.  So, when we figure something out, and think it's too simple for an all-knowing God to make, maybe we should remember that simplicity comes from brilliance. 
There are things, too, in the Bible that don't make prefectly clear sense.  Like the book of Genesis, - Creation.  Fundamentalists think it all happened in 7 days.  Who's to say that one day God didn't speak matter (that ultimately made up earth) into being, and leave it alone for a while.  He could have given each atom its gravity, or heck, even started everything with hydrogen, let it pull together, create friction, explode, sending our galaxy flying out from itself.  Then pick up at a point where the laws he put into place left off.   
It seems to me that an intelligent designer would make more sense to Scientists than a poker game.  again, like I said, I'm an amatuer when it comes to this stuff.  It fascinates me, but I still don't believe it was accident.  And Mr. Dawkins can call me what he will, but no one will ever convince me other wise.

53. Sam Richards does a service in painting this picture of the kind of misunderstandings that might have developed. If so, how do we correct them? 
They clearly are misunderstandings. We import more oil from Canada than from the entire Persian Gulf, but without invading Canada. Freedom is not inconsistent with commerce. Saddam was happy to sell oil under the Oil For Food program that was filling his treasury and that of the UN (while providing little for the Iraqi people). Oil is fungible, it didn't matter if he sold directly to us. Iraq now exports most of its oil to Asia. The problem was something else. 
Canada and Iraq have similar sized populations, but if a minority of Canadians were to impose a cruel and hostile dictatorship in that country, most in the US would support its liberation. 
We created and supported the Arafat dictatorship in the name of stability, not oil&mdash;no oil there. It did not work, it does not work. We mistook oppression for peace. Our conceit was in thinking that Arabs were too primitive to be free. Not "like us". Condoning or even supporting stable dictatorships leads, however, to greater resentment, as local economic injustice grows and the tyrant seeks a scapegoat. 
I expect that some Arabs feel the way Richards describes, but I think a more apt analogy would be local miners who, having been coerced into mining or into selling their mineral rights, remain poor as the local management of the mines becomes wealthy. The problem wouldn't so much be the commerce in coal, but the local injustice. Certainly many Arabs were recruited to fight against the liberation of Iraq, just as those miners might face locals who were recruited by the tyrannical company bosses.  
To me, the most stirring image Richards showed was of the person proudly showing their purple fingertip, the mark of one who voted--and unlike under the Saddam regime, this vote was not coerced. How do Iraqis see our happiness for them? 
And the dominoes are still falling in North Africa.

55. First: it's called learning and memory, something known for long time (for instance the debate between nature and nurture; if you want to use pop culture language you could say 'genes vs memes') This whole meme thing is stupid, instead of coming up with other silly catchy names for human faculties that we've always known exist and trying to pass it off as science maybe you should just continue the study of ideology, memory, and education that has a long and rich tradition (and could maybe give you a bit of a head start).  
Second: it's not science; there are aspects of it that are science (like the biology of the brain, neuroscience, genetics, etc), but the study of ideas, whether others remember and use them or not, has always been and likely always will be in the realm of philosphy. Yes we can study why and how ideas are passed on, why they gain mass followings (as in the case of fascism or communism) and we should and do, but it's NOT SCIENCE.

58. I like the premise/message of the talk a lot and agree that we're in no danger of running out of things to investigate, probably the reverse is true as we develop more powerful tools and a better understanding of the world around us. 
I wonder, though, whether the young girl who asked the question on which the talk is based really would be satisfied with this kind of answer.  Those renowned as the great explorers of history have been people who have discovered new places and charted unknown geographical/astronomical spaces, not those revealing the hidden depths of the sciences.  This is not to say that I think one is better than the other, but I think we do normally distinguish between great scientists like Newton and great explorers like Scott and that, therefore, the speaker is really dodging the question put to him by redefining what we ordinarily mean by the term "explorer" to include what most people would not view as exploration. 
Einstein, for example, discovered new "spaces" in physics and in his own sense "explored" the world in a different way, but I don't really think that's what most people (and probably the young girl) mean when they talk about exploration.  I would certainly find it odd to hear someone describe Einstein as an explorer. 
The romantic notions of exploration being tied up with new cultural experiences, unpredictable social situations, physical hardship and, above all, personal risk are what turned the great explorers into the sources of wonder and objects of literary/media attention that they were for the general population.  These are factors entirely missing from the somewhat different, distinctly safer form of "exploration" the speaker is talking about.  Again, I am not suggesting at all that scientific development or discovery is less valuable, just that it isn't the same thing. 
Perhaps the redefinition of "exploration" implied by the talk is a necessary consequence of having mapped the (non-submerged) planet, but it's a shame if so.

59. why did he lie about the reason Tesla wan't able to generate free electricity? is it that he just didn't know? Cuz the truth is all over the internet.  For those who don't know do some research on this embarassing piece of American History.  
Also, I know TED isn't politically inclined, but i'm disappointed with this. I thought TED was meant to expose people such as Tesla and their ideas without the limitations of bureaucracy, the exact problem Tesla had.

60. I personally liked the talk very much and especially net is not a noun its a verb part.We all use internet and i am sure 99% of us used wikipedia at least once,so gained time and effort and found what we were looking for easier,but what did we give back?He is just happy to see that this "random act of kindness" is there.But we all know if you feel gratitude you do these kinds of acts and they bring happiness,interesting to acknowledge that we feel gratitude to the net...
